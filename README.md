# podcast_scraping_project

The objective of this web scraping project was to generate insights from the top podcasts in the United States. 

To collect the podcast data, I scraped a [third-party website]('https://www.chartable.com'). Included in the data was:

    1. Rank number on respective platform (ex: Spotify)
    2. Name of the podcast
    3. Network producing the podcast (if available)
    4. Date the data was collected
    5. Genre/s of the podcast (if available)
    6. How many stars out of 5 it is rated
    7. How many users have rated the podcast
    8. The date each individual episode was released
